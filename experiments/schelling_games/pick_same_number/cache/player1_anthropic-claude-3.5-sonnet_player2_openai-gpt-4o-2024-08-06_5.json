In coordination games, success depends on selecting a number that would be naturally focal or salient to both players.\n\nLooking at the numbers [11, 25, 42, 78, 90], I notice that 42 stands out for several reasons:\n1. It's positioned in the middle of the list\n2. It's a culturally significant number (famous as \"the answer to life, the universe, and everything\" from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)\n3. It's likely to be salient to AI models given its prominence in tech/geek culture\n\nSince both players are AI language models and would have similar training data exposure, 42 seems like the most focal point for coordination.\n\n<choice>42</choice>", "extracted_choice": 42}, {"role": "player2", "full_response": "<choice>42</choice>", "extracted_choice": 42}]}, "error": null}
