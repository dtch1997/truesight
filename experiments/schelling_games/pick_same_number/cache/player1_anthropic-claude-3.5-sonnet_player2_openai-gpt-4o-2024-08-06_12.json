Since both players want to coordinate, I need to identify which number would be most salient or focal for both of us.\n\nLooking at the numbers [64, 46, 39, 98, 86], a few potential focal points emerge:\n- 98 is the highest number\n- 39 is the lowest number\n- 64 is the first number in the list\n\nAmong these, I believe the first number (64) is likely to be most salient because:\n1. It has primacy in the list\n2. It's a clean, memorable number (8x8)\n3. First items in a list often serve as natural focal points in coordination games\n\n<choice>64</choice>", "extracted_choice": 64}, {"role": "player2", "full_response": "<choice>86</choice>", "extracted_choice": 86}]}, "error": null}
