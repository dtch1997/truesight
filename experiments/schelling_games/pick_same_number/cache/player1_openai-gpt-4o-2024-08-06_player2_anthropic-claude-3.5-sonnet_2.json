Since both players are seeing the same list and need to coordinate, I should focus on what makes a number stand out or be focal.\n\nThe numbers are: 68, 21, 26, 55, 97\n\nLooking at these numbers:\n- 97 is the highest number\n- 21 is the lowest number\n- 55 is close to the middle of the range and seems visually distinctive being a double digit\n- 68 and 26 don't have any particularly distinctive features, though 26 has digits that are consecutive (2,6)\n\nI think 55 would be the most focal choice because:\n1. It's in the middle of the range\n2. It has repeating digits which makes it more memorable\n3. It's a multiple of 5, which humans and AIs might naturally gravitate toward\n4.
