Round numbers\n2. Extreme values (highest/lowest)\n3. Numbers that are somehow special or memorable\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe 10 is the most salient choice because:\n- It's the only round number in the list\n- It's positioned in the middle of the list\n- It's a simple, clean number that's easy to remember\n- It's culturally significant as a base-10 number\n\n<choice>10</choice>", "extracted_choice": 10}, {"role": "player2", "full_response": "Let me think about this strategically.
