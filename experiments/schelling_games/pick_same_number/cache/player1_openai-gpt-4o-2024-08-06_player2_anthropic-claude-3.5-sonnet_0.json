Since both players see the same list and want to coordinate, I should choose a number that stands out and would be naturally focal to both players.\n\nLooking at [40, 76, 88, 99, 50], a few potential focal points emerge:\n- 99 stands out as the highest number\n- 88 is notable for being a \"double digit\" number\n- 40 and 50 are \"round\" numbers in base 10\n\nAmong these, I think 99 is most salient - it's the highest number, ends the 90s sequence, and is memorable as \"almost 100\". This seems like it would be a natural focal point that another player would also gravitate towards.\n\n<choice>99</choice>", "extracted_choice": 99}]}, "error": null}
