To coordinate successfully, I need to choose a number that would be naturally focal or salient to both players.\n\nLooking at the numbers [96, 38, 88, 90, 75], there are a few potential focal points:\n- 88 stands out as it has repeating digits\n- 90 is notable for being a round number\n- 38 is the smallest number\n- 96 is the largest number\n\nAmong these, I think 88 is the most salient due to its pattern of repeating digits. This type of pattern is something that would likely catch both players' attention and serve as a natural coordination point.\n\n<choice>88</choice>", "extracted_choice": 88}]}, "error": null}
