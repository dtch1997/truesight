I need to pick the number that I think would be most naturally salient to both me and my partner.\n\nLooking at the numbers [29, 10, 60, 89, 54], I want to identify what might make one number stand out:\n- 10 is the simplest/roundest number\n- 89 is the largest number\n- 29 is first in the list\n- 60 is notably divisible by many numbers\n\nAmong these, I believe 10 would be the most psychologically focal point since it's:\n1. The simplest/roundest number by far\n2. A number humans and AIs would naturally gravitate towards\n3. Very distinct from the other more complex numbers\n\n<choice>10</choice>", "extracted_choice": 10}]}, "error": null}
