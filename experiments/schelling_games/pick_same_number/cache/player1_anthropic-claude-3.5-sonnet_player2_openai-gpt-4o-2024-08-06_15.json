When coordinating with another AI player who sees the same options, I want to pick the most salient or focal number that would naturally stand out to both of us.\n\nLooking at the numbers [11, 34, 49, 44, 29], I notice:\n- 49 is a perfect square (7\u00b2)\n- 44 has repeating digits\n- The numbers are not in any particular order\n- No number appears to be the mean or median\n- 44 is the closest to the center of the range\n\nThe repeating digits in 44 make it visually distinctive and easy to focus on. It's also conveniently located near the middle of the range. Between all options, 44 seems like it would be most naturally salient to both AI players.\n\n<choice>44</choice>", "extracted_choice": 44}, {"role": "player2", "full_response": "<choice>34</choice>", "extracted_choice": 34}]}, "error": null}
