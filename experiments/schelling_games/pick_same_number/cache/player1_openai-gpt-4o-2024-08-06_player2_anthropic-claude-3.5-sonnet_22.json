I need to pick a number that would be naturally salient to both players.\n\nLooking at the numbers [54, 41, 60, 63, 9], a few potential focal points stand out:\n- 9 is notably different as the only single-digit number\n- 63 is the largest number\n- 54 is the first number in the list\n- 60 might be salient as a round number divisible by 10\n\nAmong these, I believe 9 is the most distinctive and memorable due to being the only single-digit number and being dramatically different from all other options. Its uniqueness makes it a natural coordination point that would likely stand out to any player regardless of model type.\n\n<choice>9</choice>", "extracted_choice": 9}]}, "error": null}
