Since both players want to coordinate and see the same list, we should focus on what makes a number stand out.\n\nLooking at the numbers [7, 24, 21, 72, 31]:\n- 7 stands out as the smallest and only single-digit number\n- 72 is notable as it's the largest number\n- 24 and 21 are similar two-digit numbers starting with 2\n- 31 doesn't have any particularly distinctive features\n\nAmong these, 7 seems most focal because:\n1. It's uniquely simple and small\n2. It's a culturally significant number in many contexts\n3. It's visually distinct from the other options\n4.
