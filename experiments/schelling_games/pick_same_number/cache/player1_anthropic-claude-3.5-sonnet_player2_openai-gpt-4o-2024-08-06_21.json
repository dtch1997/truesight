It's a psychologically significant number (100%)\n\nSince both players see these same numbers in the same order and are likely using similar reasoning processes, 100 seems like the most natural focal point for coordination.\n\n<choice>100</choice>", "extracted_choice": 100}, {"role": "player2", "full_response": "<choice>100</choice>", "extracted_choice": 100}]}, "error": null}
