A few key considerations:\n\n1. Position: First or last numbers are naturally salient\n2. Magnitude: Notably high/low numbers or round numbers tend to be focal\n3. Pattern recognition: Numbers with special properties might be focal\n\nIn this case, I notice that:\n- 2 is both the smallest number and the last in the list\n- 90 is the only round number that's a multiple of 10\n- The other numbers (19, 28, 97) don't have particularly distinctive properties\n\nBetween these options, I think 2 is the most focal point - it's the smallest by far, easiest to process, and in the attention-getting final position.\n\n<choice>2</choice>", "extracted_choice": 2}, {"role": "player2", "full_response": "<choice>19</choice>", "extracted_choice": 19}]}, "error": null}
