Since both players see the same list and want to coordinate, we should look for a number that stands out or would naturally draw attention.\n\nLooking at [83, 49, 82, 80, 94]:\n- 94 is the highest number\n- 49 is the lowest number and the only one in the 40s\n- The other numbers (83, 82, 80) are all in the 80s range\n\n49 stands out significantly as it's the only number in the 40s and is the lowest number.
