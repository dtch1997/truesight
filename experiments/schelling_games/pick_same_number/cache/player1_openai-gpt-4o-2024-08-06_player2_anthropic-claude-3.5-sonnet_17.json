Since both players see the same list in the same order, I should focus on what makes a number stand out as a natural focal point.\n\nAmong [84, 76, 60, 48, 65], some potential focal points are:\n- First number (84)\n- Middle number (60)\n- Largest number (84)\n- Smallest number (48)\n\nThe middle number 60 seems most salient here because:\n1. It's in the center position of the list\n2. It's a round number (divisible by 10)\n3. It's relatively easy to spot visually\n\nBoth players would likely recognize these properties, making 60 a natural coordination point.\n\n<choice>60</choice>", "extracted_choice": 60}]}, "error": null}
