Since both players need to coordinate without communication, we need to find a focal point that would stand out to both of us.\n\nLooking at the numbers [86, 25, 78, 81, 90], I notice:\n- 25 stands out as being much smaller than the others\n- 90 is the highest and a \"round\" number ending in 0\n- The other numbers don't have any particularly distinctive properties\n\n25 is the most unique and salient number in the list since it's significantly smaller than all others and is also a perfect square (5\u00d75). This distinctiveness makes it the most likely focal point for coordination.\n\n<choice>25</choice>", "extracted_choice": 25}]}, "error": null}
